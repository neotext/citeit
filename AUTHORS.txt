INSPIRATION:
Neotext was created by Tim Langeman, and inspired by Ted Nelson.
The idea for the project arose while Tim was writing an article reviewing
Ted Nelson's Ph.D thesis titled "Philosophy of Hypertext".

You can read more about Ted Nelson's vision of hypertext.

Neotext is a continuation of the "Worse is Better" aproach to hypertext,
but is intended to inspire others to work a fuller vision, more in keeping
with Nelson's Xanadu.
