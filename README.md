Citeit API

The CiteIt API allows web authors to demonstrate the context of their quotations by 
retrieving the 500 characters before and after the quote they are citing.

It saves this contextual data in json files that can be retrieved by 
web pages that use the CiteIt Wordpress plugin or jQuery library.
